# Employee_Data_Analysis
I worked on a dataset which contains detailed information about employees, including personal details, employment status, department, performance scores, and more.
In order to complete the goal of this project, i followed some steps.
- Using SQL, i filtered the employee data based on specific criteria.
- With the filtered dataset, via Python, i performed a detailed analysis of the average salary and employee satisfaction across different departments. Then i visualized the results, using a bar chart to better understand the distribution of these metrics.
- I explored the relationship between the number of absences and employee performance, calculated the average number of absences for each performance score category and created a bar chart to visualize my findings.
- Finally, i analized the distribution of employees across various departments and delved into the salary statistics within each department. I presented this information using a pie chart and provided additional insights through statistical analysis.
